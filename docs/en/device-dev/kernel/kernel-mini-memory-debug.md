# Memory Debugging<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001079036426"></a>

The purpose of memory debugging is to locate problems related to dynamic memory. The kernel provides a variety of memory debugging methods. Dynamic memory pool statistics helps you learn the memory pool waterline and fragmentation rate. Memory leak check helps you accurately locate the code where memory leak occurs and analyze the memory usage of each module. Memory corruption check helps you locate memory corruptions.
