# Panda Binary File Format

This document describes Panda binary file format with the following goals in mind:

* Compactness
* Support for fast access to information
* Support for low memory footprint
* Extensibility and compatibility

## Compactness

Many mobile applications use a lot of types, methods and fields. Their number is so large that they
cannot be fit in 16-bit unsigned integer. This forces application developers to create several files.
As a result not all data can be deduplicated.

The current binary file format should extend these limits to conform to the modern requirements.

To achieve this, all references in the binary file are 4 bytes long. It allows a space of 4GB
for addressing fields, methods, classes, etc.

The format uses [TaggedValue](#taggedvalue), which stores only information we have,
avoiding 0 offsets for absent information and saving more space.

However, to achive more compactness, 16-bit indexes are used to refer classes, methods and fields in
the bytecode and some metadata. The file can contain multiple indexes, each one which covers part of
the file and is described by [RegionHeader](#regionheader).

## Fast information access

Binary file format should support fast access to information. It means that
redundant references should be avoided. Also, if it is possible, binary file format should avoid data
indexes (like sorted list of strings). However, the described binary file format supports one index:
a sorted list of offsets to classes. This index is compact and allows quicky location of a type definition,
which is requested frequently by runtime during application launch time.

All classes, fields and methods are separated into 2 groups: foreign and local.
Foreign classes, fields and methods are declared in other files, with references from the
current binary file. Local classes, fields and methods are declared in the current file.
Local entities have the same header as the corresponding foreign. So
if we have an offset to an entity it doesn't matter whether it is local or foreign.

Runtime can easily check the type of an offset by checking if it is in the foreign region
(*\[foreign_off; foreign_off + foreign_size)*).
Depending on the result, runtime can search the entity in other files (for foreign entities)
or create a runtime object from the definition by the offset (for local entities).

To improve data access speed, most data structures have 4 bytes alignment.
Since most target architectures are little endian, all multibyte values are little endian.

## Offsets

Unless otherwise specified, all offsets are calculated from the beginning of the file.
The value 0 of an offset means that there is no data.
An offset cannot contain values in the range *\[0; 32)*.

## Support for low memory footprint

As practice shows, most of file data is not used by the application. It means memory footprint
of a file can be significantly reduced by grouping frequently used data.
To support this feature, the described binary file format uses offsets and doesn't specify how
structures should be located relatively to each other.

## Extensibility and compatibility

The binary file format supports future changes via version number.
The version field in the header is 4 bytes long and is encoded as a byte array to
avoid misinterpretation on platforms with different endianess.

Any tool which supports format version `N` must support format version `N - 1` too.

## Data types

| Type       | Description                                  |
| ----       | -----------                                  |
| `uint8_t`  | 8-bit unsigned integer value.                |
| `uint32_t` | 32-bit little endian unsigned integer value. |
| `uleb128`  | unsigned integer value in LEB128 encoding.   |
| `sleb128`  | signed integer value in LEB128 encoding.     |

### MUTF-8 Encoding

Binary file format uses MUTF-8 (Modified UTF-8) encoding for strings. Encoding is described here:

* [JVM Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se9/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7)

### String

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name               | Format        | Description |
| ----               | ------        | ----------- |
| `utf16_length`     | `uleb128`     | Length of the string in UTF-16 code units. It's the number `java.lang.String.length()` returns. |
| `data`             | `uint8_t[]`   | 0-terminated character sequence in MUTF-8 encoding. |

### TaggedValue

Alignment: none

Format:

| Name               | Format        | Description |
| ----               | ------        | ----------- |
| `tag_value`        | `uint8_t`     | The first 8 bits contain a tag which determines the meaning of the data. Depending on the tag there may be optional data. Runtime must be able to determine size of the data. |
| `data`             | `uint8_t[]`   | Optional payload. |

## String syntax

### TypeDescriptor

```
TypeDescriptor -> PrimitiveType | ArrayType | RefType
PrimitiveType  -> 'Z' | 'B' | 'H' | 'S' | 'C' | 'I' | 'U' | 'J' | 'Q' | 'F' | 'D' | 'A'
ArrayType      -> '[' TypeDescriptor
RefType        -> 'L' ClassName ';'
```

`PrimitiveType` is a one-letter encoding for primitive type.

| Type  | Encoding |
| ----  | :--: |
| `u1`  | `Z` |
| `i8`  | `B` |
| `u8`  | `H` |
| `i16` | `S` |
| `u16` | `C` |
| `i32` | `I` |
| `u32` | `U` |
| `f32` | `F` |
| `f64` | `D` |
| `i64` | `J` |
| `u64` | `Q` |
| `any` | `A` |

`ClassName` is a qualified name of a class with `.` replaced with `/`.

### RegionHeader

To address file structures using 16-bit indexes file is splitted into regions. Each region has class, method, field and proto indexes and is described by `RegionHeader` structure.

Alignment: 4 bytes

### RegionIndex

`RegionIndex` structure is aimed to allow runtime to find index structure that covers the specified offset in the file.
It is organized as an array of offsets from the beginning of the file to the [RegionHeader](#regionheader) structures.
All the offsets are sorted by the start offset of the region. The number of elements in the index is determined by `num_index_regions`
from [Header](#header).

| `field_data`       | `TaggedValue[]` | Variable length list of tagged values. Each element must have type [TaggedValue](#taggedvalue). Tag values must be those defined in [FieldTag](#fieldtag) and in ascending order (except `0x00` tag). |

Note: Proper region index to resolve `class_idx` and `type_idx` can be found by the field's offset.

### FieldTag

| Name                      | Tag    | Quantity | Data format  | Description |
| ----                      | :-:    | :------: | -----------  | ----------- |
| `NOTHING`                 | `0x00` | `1`      | `none`       | No more values. The value with this tag must be the last. |
| `INT_VALUE`               | `0x01` | `0-1`    | `sleb128`    | Integral value of the field. This tag is used when the field has type `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short` or `int` |
| `VALUE`                   | `0x02` | `0-1`    | `uint8_t[4]` | Data represents the offset to the field's value. This format is used in case the field has type float, double or long which doesn't fin in 7 bytes). If 32 bits are enough to encode the value it contains value in the [Value](#value) format. Otherwise it contains offset to the field's value in the [Value](#value) format. |
| `RUNTIME_ANNOTATIONS`     | `0x03` | `>=0`    | `uint8_t[4]` | Offset to runtime **visible** annotation of the field. The tag may be repeated in case the field has several annotations. The offset must point to the value in [Annotation](#annotation) format. |
| `ANNOTATIONS`             | `0x04` | `>=0`    | `uint8_t[4]` | Offset to runtime **invisible** annotation of the field. The tag may be repeated in case the field has several annotations. The offset must point to the value in [Annotation](#annotation) format. |
| `RUNTIME_TYPE_ANNOTATION` | `0x05` | `>=0`    | `uint8_t[4]` | Offset to runtime **visible** type annotation of the field. The tag may be repeated in case the field has several annotations. The offset must point to the value in [Annotation](#annotation) format. |

Note: Only `INT_VALUE` or `VALUE` tags must be present.

### FieldType

Since the first bytes of the file contain the header and the size of the header is greater than 16 bytes, any offset in the range `[0; sizeof(Header))` is invalid.
`FieldType` encoding uses this fact to encode primitive types of the field in the low 4 bits.
For non-primitive type the value is an offset to [Class](#class) or to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass). In both cases [FieldType](#fieldtype) is `uint32_t`.

Primitive types are encoded as follows:

| Type  | Code |
| ----  | :--: |
| `u1`  | 0x00 |
| `i8`  | 0x01 |
| `u8`  | 0x02 |
| `i16` | 0x03 |
| `u16` | 0x04 |
| `i32` | 0x05 |
| `u32` | 0x06 |
| `f32` | 0x07 |

| `reference_types`  | `uint16_t[]`  | Array of indexes of the method's signature non-primitive types. For each non-primitive type in the shorty there is the corresponding element in the array. The size of the array is equal to the number of reference types in the shorty. |

Note: Proper region indexes to resolve interface type indexes can be found by the prototype's offset.

#### Shorty

Shorty is a short description of method's signature without detailed information about reference types.
A shorty begins with a return type followed by method arguments and ends with `0x0`.

Shorty syntax:

```
Shorty -> ReturnType ParamTypeList End
ReturnType -> Type
ParamTypeList -> '' | Type ParamTypeList
Type -> <encoded type>
End -> 0x0
```

`<encoded type>` must be one of:

| Type   | Value   |
| ----   | :---:   |
| `void` | `0x01`  |
| `u1`   | `0x02`  |
| `i8`   | `0x03`  |
| `u8`   | `0x04`  |
| `i16`  | `0x05`  |
| `u16`  | `0x06`  |
| `i32`  | `0x07`  |
| `u32`  | `0x08`  |
| `f32`  | `0x09`  |
| `f64`  | `0x0a`  |
| `i64`  | `0x0b`  |
| `u64`  | `0x0c`  |
| `ref`  | `0x0d`  |
| `any`  | `0x0e`  |

All shorty elements are divided into groups by 8 elements starting from the beginning.
Each group is encoded in `uint16_t`. Each element is encoded in 4 bits.
A group with 4 elements `v1`, `v2`, ..., `v4` is encoded in `uint16_t` as follows:

```
| bits   | 0 - 3 | 4 - 7 | 8 - 11 | 12 - 15 |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| values | v1    | v2    | v3     | v4      |
```

If the group contains less than 8 elements the rest bits are filled with `0x0`.

### DebugInfo

Debug information contains the mapping between program counters of a method and line numbers in sourcecode and information about local variables. The format is derived from DWARF Debugging Information Format, Version 3 (see item 6.2). The mapping and local variable information are encoded in [line number program](#line-number-program) which is interpreted by [the state machine](#state-machine). To deduplicate the same line number programs in different methods, all constants that the program refers to are moved into [the constant pool](#constant-pool).

| Name                      | Format          | Description |
| ----                      | ------          | ----------- |
| `line_start`              | `uleb128`       | The initial value of line register of [the state machine](#state-machine). |

| `constant_pool`           | `uleb128[]`     | [Constant pool](#constant-pool) data of length `constant_pool_size` bytes. |
| `line_number_program_idx` | `uleb128`       | [Line number program](#line-number-program) index in a [`LineNumberProgramIndex`](#linenumberprogramindex) structure. The program has a variable length and ends with `DBG_END_SEQUENCE` opcode. |

#### Constant pool

Many methods have similar line number program. The difference is only in variable names,
variable types and file names. To deduplicate such programs all constants the program refers to
are stored in the constant pool. During interpretation of the program
[the state machine](#state-machine) tracks a pointer to the constant pool.
When [the state machine](#state-machine) interprets an instruction which requires a constant
argument the machine reads the value from memory constant pool pointer points to and then increments
the pointer. Thus programs have no explicit references to constants and can be deduplicated.

#### State Machine

The aim of the state machine is to generate a mapping between program counters and line numbers and
local variable information. The machine has the following registers:

| Name                 | Initial value | Description       |
| ----                 | ------------- | ----------------- |
| `address`            | 0             | Program counter (refers to method's instructions). Must only monotonically increase. |
| `line`               | `line_start` from [DebugInfo](#debug_info). | Unsigned integer which corresponds to line number in source code. All lines are numbered beginning at 1 so the register mustn't have value less than 1. |
| `file`               | Value of `SOURCE_FILE` tag in `class_data` (see [Class](#class)) or 0 | Offset to the name of source file. If there is no such information (`SOURCE_FILE` tag is absent in [Class](#class)) then the register has value 0. |
| `prologue_end`       | `false`       | The register indicates the current address is one where entry breakpoint of the method could be set. |
| `epilogue_begin`     | `false`       | The register indicates the current address is one where exit breakpoint of the method could be set. |
| `constant_pool_ptr`  | Address of the `constant_pool`'s first byte from [DebugInfo](#debug_info). | Pointer to the current constant value. |

#### Line Number Program

A line number program consists of instructions. Each instruction has one byte opcode and optional arguments. Depending on the opcode, the argument's value may be encoded into the instruction or the instruction requires reading the value from the constant pool.

| Opcode                 | Value        | Instruction Format | Constant pool arguments   | Description                           |
| ------                 | -----        | ------------------ | -----------------------   | -----------                           |
| `END_SEQUENCE`         | `0x00`       |                    |                           | Mark the end of line number program. |

The number of the register contains the variable is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. The name is an offset to [String](#String) and the type is an offset to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass) or [Class](#class). The offsets may be `0` which means the corresponding information is absent. |
| `START_LOCAL_EXTENDED` | `0x04`       | `sleb128`          | `uleb128 uleb128 uleb128` | Introduce a local variable with name, type and type signature the *constant_pool_ptr* refers to at the current address. The number of the register contains the variable is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. The name is an offset to [String](#String), the type is an offset to [ForeignClass](#foreignclass) or [Class](#class) and the signature is an offset to [String](#string). The offsets may be `0` which means the corresponding information is absent. |
| `END_LOCAL`            | `0x05`       | `sleb128`          |                           | Mark the local variable in the specified register is out of scope. The register number is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. |
| `RESTART_LOCAL`        | `0x06`       | `sleb128`          |                           | Re-introduces a local variable at the specified register. The name and type are the same as the last local that was in the register. The register number is encoded in the instruction. The register's value `-1` means the accumulator register. |
| `SET_PROLOGUE_END`     | `0x07`       |                    |                           | Set `prologue_end` register to `true`. Any special opcodes clear `prologue_end` register. |
| `SET_EPILOGUE_BEGIN`   | `0x08`       |                    |                           | Set `epilogue_end` register to `true`. Any special opcodes clear `epilogue_end` register. |
| `SET_FILE`             | `0x09`       |                    | `uleb128`                 | Set `file` register to the value `constant_pool_ptr` refers to. The argument is an offset to [String](#string) which represents the file name or `0`. |
| `SET_SOURCE_CODE`      | `0x0a`       |                    | `uleb128`                 | Set `source_code` register to the value `constant_pool_ptr` refers to. The argument is an offset to [String](#string) which represents the source code or `0`. |
| Special opcodes        | `0x0b..0xff` |                    |                           | |

Special opcodes:

[The state machine](#state-machine) interprets each special opcode as follows
(see DWARF Debugging Information Format item 6.2.5.1 Special Opcodes):

1. Calculates the adjusted opcode: `adjusted_opcode = opcode - OPCODE_BASE`.
2. Increments `address` register: `address += adjusted_opcode / LINE_RANGE`.
3. Increments `line` register: `line += LINE_BASE + (adjusted_opcode % LINE_RANGE)`.
4. Emits the  line number.
5. Sets `prologue_end` register to `false`.
6. Sets `epilogue_begin` register to `false`.

Where:

* `OPCODE_BASE = 0x0a`: the first special opcode.
* `LINE_BASE = -4`: the smallest line number increment.
* `LINE_RANGE = 15`: the number of line increments presented.
