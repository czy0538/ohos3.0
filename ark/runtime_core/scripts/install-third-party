# When public OpenHarmony source tree is available:
# * List all required third party components in a manifest:
#
#      library-1      remote-url-1
#      library-2      remote-url-2
#      <...>
#
# * Clone each component separately, based on the manifest
# * Enable this script to work with custom manifests to allow
#   avoid depenencies on OpenHarmony infrastructure
# * Remove dependency on private GitLab (and, eventually, GITLAB_PULL_TOKEN)
# * If we need to apply patches to third party libs,
#   need to support according machinery as well.
